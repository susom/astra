// MARK: - Runtime↔Models cycle break (Track A2)
//
// Two value types that moved here from the app target as part of breaking the
// Models↔Runtime cycle (`WorkspaceExecutionEnvironment`'s credential-projection
// sanitizer, `TaskRoleProfile.runtime`) need small pieces of behavior that only
// the app target's `Astra/Services/Runtime/*.swift` can provide: (1) whether a
// filesystem path is safe to trust as a credential source (the sandbox's
// broad-root/canonicalization policy), and (2) resolving a raw runtime-ID
// string against the live set of registered provider adapters. Both are
// backed by substantial, genuinely Runtime-specific state (a ~1,070-line
// sandbox-exec policy engine; a 6-provider adapter catalog) that must not be
// duplicated or relocated here — so ASTRACore declares the seam only, and the
// app target's `ExecutionSandbox` / `AgentRuntimeAdapterRegistry` conform.
//
// Swift has no module-load hook (no ObjC-style `+load`, no guaranteed
// eager top-level initializers in a library target — verified empirically
// before choosing this design), so registration is **explicit, not
// automatic**: `Astra/Services/Runtime/RuntimeSeamRegistration.swift` exposes
// `RuntimeSeamRegistration.registerAll()`, called from `ASTRAApp.init()` for
// the shipping app. The ASTRATests bundle borrows C's load-time hook
// instead: a `__attribute__((constructor))` in the test-only
// `AstraTestSeamBootstrap` target calls `registerAll()` when dyld loads the
// bundle, before either test framework schedules a suite (see
// `Tests/RuntimeSeamTestBootstrap.swift`; individual suites must not
// register — fitness-enforced).
// Accessing either seam before registration is a programmer error, not a
// silently-degraded security check: both trap with `preconditionFailure`
// rather than failing open or returning a guessed answer.
//
// Swift Testing runs suite initializers concurrently on different GCD worker
// threads by default (no implicit `.serialized`). Before the load-time test
// bootstrap existed, suites registered these seams from stored-property
// initializers in parallel, and a plain `static var` here made
// `registerAll()` a data race — confirmed empirically with
// `swift test --sanitize=thread` before this locking was added. Test
// registration is single-threaded now (a dyld image initializer), but reads
// still race each other and the production `registerAll()`, so both seams
// keep their backing value behind an `OSAllocatedUnfairLock` rather than a
// bare Optional static.
