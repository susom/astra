/// `which` + a liveness probe + an optional semantic check against stdout.
///
/// Four cases, in rough "pain" order:
///   - `healthy`       — binary resolves, liveness probe exits 0, and any
///                       semantic check passed. User can run the skill.
///   - `unauthenticated` — binary resolves and runs but a semantic probe
///                       (e.g. `gcloud auth list`) says no active identity.
///                       User needs to log in; the app can link to the fix.
///   - `unresponsive`  — binary resolves but the liveness probe timed out
///                       or exited non-zero. Often means broken install or
///                       hung background state.
///   - `missingBinary` — `which` / PATH scan returned nothing. User needs
///                       to install it.

/// binary is in a "good" state *beyond* simply exiting 0. Typical use:
/// `gcloud auth list --format=value(account)` exits 0 even when the user
/// has no active account — the output is just empty. Semantic checks catch
/// that.
///
/// Encoded as an enum (not a closure) so it can be stored in `Codable`
/// prerequisite specs. The checker resolves the enum to behaviour.
public enum SemanticCheck: String, Codable, Sendable, Equatable {

/// Design notes:
///   - We deliberately prefer `/usr/bin/env which` over a PATH-scan to
///     match the user's actual shell lookup behaviour (respects user
///     aliases via env, doesn't care whether `which` is a builtin).
///   - `/usr/bin/env` itself is guaranteed to exist on macOS. If it
///     doesn't, the machine is broken at a level we can't recover from.
///   - Liveness timeout default is short (3s). A binary that can't answer
///     `--version` in 3s is effectively unresponsive for interactive use.
