/// Reconciles a persisted Tier 2 (utility-model) objective assessment against
/// Tier 1's deterministic resolver on every `refresh()`, in three ways:
///
///  1. If Tier 1 now finds a newer, more authoritative signal -- either an
///     explicit objective-override message (`activeObjectiveResolution(...)
///     .hasExplicitOverride`, true regardless of whether the override's
///     resolved text differs from `task.goal` -- a user who explicitly says
///     "go back to the original goal" still just issued a fresh correction,
///     even though `supersedesOriginalGoal` alone would read that as "nothing
///     changed") or an approved/executing/completed plan whose goal has
///     already reconciled to something other than `task.goal`
///     (`activeObjectiveResolution(...).objective != task.goal`, which
///     `hasExplicitOverride`/`supersedesOriginalGoal` do not catch -- both are
///     hardcoded `false` on the plan-reconciliation path even though the
///     resolved objective genuinely changed) -- OR the CURRENT turn's raw
///     follow-up message text is itself an explicit override
///     (`isExplicitObjectiveOverrideMessage`), since `continueSession` builds
///     the prompt before persisting that message as a `user.message` event,
///     making it invisible to `activeObjectiveResolution` until the next turn
///     -- any persisted `objectiveAssessment` is dropped entirely. A durable
///     Tier 1 signal always wins over an older, now-stale Tier 2 verdict, and
///     nothing else invalidates a persisted assessment once
///     `ObjectiveAssessmentTrigger.shouldAssess` stops re-running Tier 2 after
///     such a signal appears (adversarial findings: an explicit correction --
///     including one that reaffirms the original goal verbatim, or that
///     arrives on the very turn it's meant to take effect -- or a plan
///     approved after an earlier drift episode, must not keep surfacing that
///     earlier pivot via either the Thread Intent line or the raw "Objective
///     assessment" block).
///  2. If the opt-in "Objective Drift Detection" setting is off, any
///     persisted assessment is also dropped here -- covering the one-turn
///     gap between the user disabling the setting and
///     `AgentRuntimeRunPersistence.recordSessionTurn`'s own (write-side)
///     cleanup running for a completed turn (adversarial finding: the
///     thread-state refresh must not keep applying a stale pivot for a
///     prompt built while the setting reads as off).
///  3. Otherwise, a still-valid `superseded` verdict's `currentObjective` is
///     copied into `state.currentObjective` / `state.objective.currentObjective`.
///     Without this, `updateDerivedFields` computes `currentObjective` purely
///     from Tier 1's resolver, which never looks at `objectiveAssessment` at
///     all -- so a Tier 2 pivot (fired for exactly the informal-drift case
///     Tier 1 cannot see) would otherwise leave the stale Tier 1 text in the
///     Thread Intent "Current objective" line while a different, pivoted
///     objective renders separately in the "Objective assessment" block
///     (adversarial findings: stale-Thread-Intent-line /
///     contradictory-current-objective).
///
/// Kept in its own file per the established pattern for extending
/// `TaskContextStateManager` without growing the near-budget owner file --
/// does NOT call the owner file's private helpers (`objectiveState`,
/// `activeObjectiveResolution`'s private callees, etc.); the one piece of
/// public state it reads (`activeObjectiveResolution`) is already `static
/// func` (internal), matching `TaskActiveObjectiveResolver.swift`'s own usage.
