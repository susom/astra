                Run project commands with the ASTRA workspace MCP tool; it executes inside the Docker container. Use `workspace_shell` only for short checks; synchronous shell calls are intentionally bounded and will reject long-running build/test/dbt commands. For long-running commands such as `dbt build`, `docker build`, test suites, migrations, or cloud operations, use `workspace_job_start`, then inspect progress with `workspace_job_status`, `workspace_job_tail`, and short `workspace_job_wait` polling windows. Claude-style and Codex runtimes call these as `mcp__astra_workspace__<tool>`; the short shell tool is `mcp__astra_workspace__workspace_shell`, and durable jobs start with `mcp__astra_workspace__workspace_job_start`. GitHub Copilot CLI displays the same tools as `astra_workspace-<tool>`, including `astra_workspace-workspace_shell` and `astra_workspace-workspace_job_start`. Do not use native host Bash for project commands in this workspace. Host workspace files are bind-mounted into the container; use the container paths above while running commands and report host paths in final summaries when relevant.
                Routing contract: provider reasoning runs on host macOS, workspace shell commands run in Docker, and host control-plane actions such as GitHub PR metadata, Jira, Google Cloud, SSH, browser, and Keychain access must use ASTRA-exposed host capabilities when available. Use `mcp__astra_host__github`, `mcp__astra_host__gcloud`, `mcp__astra_host__bq`, `mcp__astra_host__ssh`, or `mcp__astra_host__jira` for host control-plane work; GitHub Copilot CLI may display these as `astra_host-github`, `astra_host-gcloud`, `astra_host-bq`, `astra_host-ssh`, and `astra_host-jira`. Do not ask a subagent to "run locally" or to use native host Bash to escape this routing; subagents must use the same Docker workspace MCP tools for project commands and ASTRA host-control MCP tools for host services. If a host control-plane capability is missing, report that capability as missing instead of trying to run a host CLI from the Docker workspace.
                Path mapping: inside workspace MCP tools, the host workspace path is mounted at \(containerCodeDir). Do not run `cd /Users/...` or use other host filesystem paths inside Docker commands; use \(containerCodeDir) and the container task folder above.
                Prefer tools installed in the image environment. Check tools by name from the container PATH, such as `command -v dbt && dbt --version`, through the ASTRA workspace MCP tool. Start long validations as managed jobs so ASTRA can track heartbeats, logs, and result files while the provider is quiet.
                When checking cloud-backed tools, verify credential readiness from inside the container before declaring GCP ready: inspect `CLOUDSDK_CONFIG`, `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, and whether the credentials file exists, then run a non-destructive auth check such as `gcloud auth application-default print-access-token --quiet` only if gcloud is installed. If this section says `Credential projections: none.`, report GCP credentials as not projected instead of inferring readiness from dbt parse or project files.
                Do not use host-created virtual environments from bind-mounted workspace paths, such as `/workspace/.venv`; macOS virtualenv symlinks and compiled extensions are not portable to Linux containers.
