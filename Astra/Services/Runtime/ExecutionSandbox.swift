/// - The write boundary is `(allow default)` + `(deny file-write*)` + scoped
///   re-allows. In Strict, the profile also denies `file-read*` and re-allows
///   only explicit workspace/input paths, provider state, temporary paths, and

///   would-deny reads without disabling the write boundary. Those reports land

///   has no logging entitlement to read another process's sandbox denials and
///   does not capture or surface them; a developer must watch the system log
///   directly during dogfooding to see a strict-scope miss.
/// - Privacy-sensitive home/media/app roots are hard-denied even in Open/Audit
