/// Launch-time pruning trims a capability's verbose skill instructions from a
/// task's prompt when the task wording doesn't obviously call for it (focus).
/// The roster is the counterweight: it keeps the agent AWARE that the capability
/// exists and how to invoke it, even when the detailed instructions were pruned —
/// so the agent never silently concludes a capability is unavailable and gives up.
///
/// This is awareness only, not authorization. Actually running a capability's
/// command still goes through the normal permission/approval and sandbox layer,
/// which is where least privilege is enforced.
