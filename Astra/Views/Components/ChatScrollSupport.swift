/// view: a bottom-sentinel reading can arrive on nearly every scroll/streaming
/// tick, and reflecting each one into `@State` would invalidate the whole view on
/// every tick even when nothing decision-relevant changed. Kept free of any
/// view/proxy dependency otherwise — `onRecover` is the only side effect — so the
/// debounce logic itself is unit-testable without hosting a live `ScrollViewProxy`.
