/// Before this model, `isWorkspaceRightRailVisible` was a plain `ContentView`
/// persisted flag written directly from four independent call sites
/// (`startWorkspaceAppStudio`, `toggleAppPreviewCanvas`, `handleSidebarToggle`,
/// `restoreRememberedWorkspaceCanvasItemIfAvailable`) in addition to the three
/// call sites that already funneled through helpers — the same "uncoordinated
/// writers" shape `SidebarPresentationModel` was built to kill for the sidebar.
/// This model consolidates all of them: the durable "rail wanted" intent
/// (`isRailShown`, persisted) and the transient active canvas item
/// (`activeCanvasItem`, remembered per-conversation) both live here, and every
/// mutation funnels through one of the methods below. `ContentView` only reads
/// the two published properties (via read-only forwarding computed
/// properties) and calls these methods — it never writes either property
/// directly.
///
/// The rendered `WorkspaceRightPanel` mode (`.canvas` takes priority over
/// `.context`, the workspace inspector rail) is still derived where it is
/// consumed, in `ContentDetailAreaView.activeRightPanel` — that view only
/// receives plain bindings, not this model, so its derivation reads the same
/// two properties this model owns.
